## Protein Info View ##

![Protein Info](../../img/proteinInfo.png)

### Representation ###

This view shows tabular information for *selected* proteins (if this view's empty, there are no proteins selected). Each selected protein is represented as an expandable section within which details for that particular protein are held. For the most part the contents of each section is a un-interactive table, displaying details associated with a protein such as its name, description, accession number, size, the number of cross-links it is involved with etc.

### Interaction ###

However, the data associated with the "Sequence" row is dynamic and interactive. Here, the protein sequence is displayed as a string, with residues involved with the current filtered set of cross-links highlighted in red and underlined. Moving the mouse pointer over one of these residues displays the cross-links it is involved with in a tooltip, and in the case of self-links will also highlight the residues at the other ends of these cross-links. Residues that do have cross-links associated with them but are currently filtered out are shown in pink, while residues with no cross-links are shown in grey. It is also useful as a quick sanity check when we know only certain residues (i.e. KSTY) should ever be cross-linked due to the type of cross-linker used in the experiment the current search is sourced from.

Selection can again be performed by left-clicking on a residue, and again any selections or highlighting performed in this view are reflected in other active views and vice versa.

Lastly, like the other views that sit in sub-panels, this view can be resized by clicking on and dragging its corners, and repositioned by clicking on and dragging the title bar. The view can be closed using the X button next to the top right-hand corner.
