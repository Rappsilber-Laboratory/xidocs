## Xi View ##

Xi View contains many different ways to view cross-link data, from circle plots, protein network views, protein sequence views and tables, to raw spectra and peak views. Data can be filtered and exported, as can images. PDB datasets can be incorporated to give physical context to the cross-links, enabling 3D and contact map views, with automatic alignment performed between Xi and PDBÂ sequences.

This documentation is divided into four logical sections:

1. Loading Data
2. Filtering Data
3. Viewing Data
4. Exporting Data


### 1. Loading Data ###

### 2. Filtering Data ###

### 3. Viewing Data ###
There are a number of different views available for exploring cross-links within Xi View. One, the XiNet view, is a constant in the main window of xiView. The others are available via the "View" drop-down menu in the menu bar along the top of the window.

The views themselves can be categorised as four basic types:

* Those that show positional cross-link data:
	1. XiNet
	2. [Circular View](./views/circular.html "Circular View")
	3. [Matrix View](./views/matrix.html "Matrix View") aka Contact Map
	4. [3D NGL View](./views/3dngl.html "3D View")
	5. [Protein Info View](./views/proteinInfo.html "Protein Info View")
	6. Spectrum View

* Those that show cross-link metadata:
	1. [Histogram View](./views/histogram.html "Histogram View")
	2. [Scatterplot View](./views/scatterplot.html "Scatterplot View")

* Those whose main purpose is to act as sanity checks:
	1. [Alignment View](./views/alignment.html "Alignment View")
	2. [Search Summaries](./views/searchSummaries.html "Search Summaries")

Finally, the [Legend View](./views/legend.html "Legend View") can be considered in a category of its own, its main function to choose and refine a colour scheme used in the rest of the Xi View interface.
