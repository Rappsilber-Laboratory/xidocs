<h2>Importing Protein Metadata from a CSV File</h2>

<p>Imported protein metadata can be used to colour the protein via 'View' > 'Legend &amp; Colours'</p>

<p>A simple example of such a CSV file is given here:</p>

<pre><code>ProteinID,Name,Quantification,Complex
P02768,A Human protein,423,ribosome
</code></pre>

<p>The columns 'Name' and 'Complex' are special cases.</p>

<p>'Name' changes the name of the protein with that ID,
if you save the layout the changed names are also saved in that layout.</p>

<p>'Complex' places the protein in a group with that name,
groups are also saved in the layout.</p>

<p>All other metadata columns are treated as follows:
- if they contain only hex colour values the protein is given that colour;
- if they contain only numerical values they are given a threshold scale with a range slider,
- anything else is assignd a categorical colout scheme based on the contents of thre column.</p>
