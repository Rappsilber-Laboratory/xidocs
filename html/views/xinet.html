<h2>XiNet View</h2>
<p><img src="../../img/xinet.png" alt="Xi Net" /></p>
<h3>Representation</h3>
<p>The XiNet view displays a collection of cross-links between proteins as an interactive network visualisation - with the proteins (nodes) shown as circles or elongated bars and the cross-links as edges drawn between these nodes at the relevant positions.</p>
<h3>Interaction</h3>
<h4>Selecting</h4>
<p>Individual cross-links can be highlighted by moving the mouse pointer over them (plus a tooltip supplies details on the particular cross-link). Similarly, cross-links can be selected by using the left mouse button. In conjunction with the CTRL key, multiple cross-links can be selected (by clicking on unselected links) and currently selected cross-links can be unselected.</p>
<p>When the mouse pointer is over a protein itself a tooltip displays basic information (for more comprehensive data, use the selected proteins view), and it can be selected by left-clicking the mouse. When used with the CTRL key this also toggles this protein's selection on/off with the existing selection.</p>
<p>Clicking with the left mouse button on the background of the view will clear all selections for both cross-links and proteins.</p>
<h4>Positioning</h4>
<p>The position of the protein relative to the rest of the network can be changed by left-clicking on the protein representation and dragging it to a new position. Also, when the protein is represented as a bar, moving the mouse pointer to just beyond the left or rightmost edge of the bar will bring a circular icon into view. Now the protein representation can be rotated around its centre by left-clicking and dragging the mouse. This is useful for adjusting protein orientations within complex networks and making patterns of cross-linking clearer.</p>
<p>Using the right mouse button when over a self cross-link (a cross-link that has both ends within a protein), will flip all the self-links to the opposite side of the bar - often useful for visually disentangling these cross-links from inter-protein cross-links.</p>
<h4>Scaling</h4>
<p>The mouse wheel can be used to change the scale of inter-protein distances - it will shrink or expand the network as a whole, using the current mouse position as a centre point, but will not change the scale of individual protein representations. Individual protein size changes are instead achieved by using the right mouse button when over a protein: this pops up a menu with options allowing a local change in scale of the protein representation or collapsing the protein completely to a small circle. At the highest scale the protein's residue sequence becomes visible within the protein's bar representation.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p>The XiNet specific menu sits in the top-right of the XiView display and contains several options for tweaking or storing the current XiNet layout.</p>
<p>Firstly, the &quot;Drag To Pan Or Select&quot; radio button pair controls whether left-clicking the mouse and dragging on the XiNet background either a) pans the network around or b) draws a rectangle, within which any encroaching protein representations are selected when the mouse button is released.</p>
<p>The &quot;Layout&quot; portion of the menu allows the Saving and Loading of multiple layout configurations for each search - a time-saver in not needing to re-create preferred manual layouts from scratch. The &quot;Auto&quot; button will relayout the entire network using a built in layout algorithm from the cola.js layout library. </p>
<p>Finally, the &quot;Image as SVG&quot; button will download an SVG (vector format) file of the current state of the XiNet view. The filename will include information on search id and current filter settings.</p>
