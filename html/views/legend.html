<h2>Xi Legend View</h2>
<p><img src="../../img/legend.png" alt="Legend View" title="Xi Legend View" /></p>
<p>This view shows both a table of representation styles used in the various xi views, and controls for changing and setting the active colour scheme used across the views.</p>
<p>The bottom half of the display is taken up with three expandable segments, each of which can be expanded / contracted using the white triangle arrows to the left of each heading.</p>
<p>The bottom two sections, &quot;Protein-Protein Level&quot; and &quot;Residue Level&quot; contain legends for the representation of two different scales of cross-link aggregation - the first for showing aggregated cross-links between  and within proteins, and the second for showing individual cross-links. The main points are that ambiguous cross-links are shown as dotted lines, and aggregated cross-link representations have a grey background whose width is proportional to the number of cross-links within the aggregation.</p>
<p>The first section, &quot;Current Cross-Link Colour Scheme&quot; contains details of the colour scheme currently used across the views. The colours under the &quot;Mark&quot; column are interactive - pressing one will allow the selection of a bespoke colour for that category.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p>The topmost button, &quot;Download Current Colour Scheme as SVG&quot;, downloads a small table of colours and categories in a vector format (SVG) that can be used to complement previously downloaded figures - as long as they use the same colour scheme.</p>
<p>The dropdown &quot;Change Cross-Link Colour Scheme&quot; is used to change the current colour scheme, of which there are four defaults:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross-Link Type - colour links by between, self or homomultimeric status</li>
<li>Protein-Protein Colouring - for small collections of proteins (up to 5) this will generate a unique colour for each possible protein-protein combination a between cross-link could have.</li>
<li>Group - for aggregated searches, each cross-link will be assigned a group colour if it is unique to that search group, otherwise, if it is common to searches in more than one group, given a default &quot;Multiple Group&quot; colour. </li>
<li>Distance - when a PDB file is loaded, this colour scheme can be used to discriminate 'within distance', 'borderline' or 'overlong' cross-links. A range slider is also available in this scale to change the cutoff values.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other colour schemes become available when loading cross-link metadata. Each non-positional column in a cross-link metadata file will be converted to a colour scheme if possible, most usually to a scale between the minimum and maximum values in the column.</p>
<p>Lastly, like the other views that sit in sub-panels, this view can be resized by clicking on and dragging its corners, and repositioned by clicking on and dragging the title bar. The view can be closed using the X button next to the top right-hand corner.</p>
