<h2>Search Summary</h2>

<h3>Representation</h3>
<p>The search summary displays an expandable/collapsible tree of metadata associated with the searches currently loaded into Xi View. This offers a sanity check for users to see if the searches they're viewing do indeed use the files and settings they think it does.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p>For searches that include cross-linker and modification information (usually sourced from the Xi Search engine) a human-readable description of the search metadata can be downloaded by pressing the &quot;Download Search Descriptions&quot; button, often useful for publications / sharing with collaborators etc.</p>
<p>Lastly, like the other views that sit in sub-panels, this view can be resized by clicking on and dragging its corners, and repositioned by clicking on and dragging the title bar. The view can be closed using the X button next to the top right-hand corner.</p>
