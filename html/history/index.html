<h2>Xi Search History Page</h2>
<p>The Xi Search History page is a paged table consisting of one row per search, with columns detailing meta-data for each search. Restricted users will see only their own searches; standard users can also see all non-private searches from other users. Superusers (Xi Administrators) can see all searches regardless of the search privacy settings.</p>
<h3>Title Bar</h3>
<p>For non-restricted users, the title bar contains a radio button option to see either only your searches or all searches you have permission to see - the default is to see only your own searches. Also, dependent on being a non-restricted user, there will be a button to launch a new search i.e. go to the <a href="../../html/searchSubmit/index.html">Search Submit</a> page. There are also buttons that link to the <a href="../../html/userGUI/index.html#userAdmin">User Admin</a> page and to log out of Xi.</p>
<h3>Table Controls</h3>
<p>Paging is controlled through the <em>Page Number</em> control at the top left.</p>
<p>Filtering is performed by entering text in the text fields below the table headers. Filters in different columns are applied conjunctively, i.e. a search must satisfy all filters to be shown.</p>
<p>Sorting can be done on columns with an arrow icon next to the filter text field. The default sort is by date.</p>
<p>These controls can be used together to find searches of interest, though generally the filtering is the most useful.</p>
<h3>Visualise a Single Search</h3>
<p>Links in the first two columns - <em>Visualise Search</em> and <em>+FDR</em> - launch the <a href="../../html/xi3/index.html">Xi Visualisation</a>. The first column's link only loads auto-validated crosslinks into the visualisation. The second column's link (<em>+FDR</em>) also loads decoy and unvalidated crosslinks, which allows basic FDR (False Discovery Rate) calculations to be used as a filter within the visualisation.</p>
<h3>Visualise Aggregated Searches</h3>
<p>Aggregate multiple searches for visualisation using the text fields in the <em>Agg Group</em> column. Enter a number in the text field for each search that should be aggregated. <strong>Number Meaning</strong>:  Searches marked with the same number will be coloured the same in the resulting visualisation - so enter the same number if you want searches to be indistinguishable, and enter different numbers for searches you wish to differentiate visually.</p>
<p>Press the <em>Aggregate</em> button in the title bar to view the aggregated searches with auto-validated links only. Press the <em>Agg. For FDR</em> button to include decoy and unvalidated links so an FDR filtering can be performed in the visualisation (exactly as for the single search).</p>
<h3>Validate a Search</h3>
<p>Press the link in the <em>Validation</em> column for a search to launch a dialog. The dialog has choices of whether to load links involving linear peptides and/or decoy proteins in the validation page.</p>
<h3>Delete a Search</h3>
<p>Delete a search by pressing the button in the <em>Delete</em> column for a search. If the button is not present, you don't have the rights to delete it. A dialog will then appear asking if you are sure you wish to delete the search - as this cannot be undone.</p>
<h3>Other Information</h3>
<p>Other columns show additional meta-data relating to individual searches.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Visualise Search</em>: The search state is appended to the name of the search in this column. This shows whether a search is queuing, being processed, has an error, or has completed. Uncompleted searches will not have a link to launch the visualisation.</li>
<li><em>Notes</em>: If a search had notes added when it was submitted in the <a href="../../html/searchSubmit/index.html">Search Submit</a> page they will be shown here. Generally a tooltip will be needed to see the full text.</li>
<li><em>Sequence</em>: The file name of the .fasta file used in the search.</li>
<li><em>Submit date</em>: The date the search was submitted.</li>
<li><em>ID</em>: Search ID.</li>
<li><em>User</em>: The user who submitted the search.</li>
</ul>
